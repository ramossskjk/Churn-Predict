Cleric,"Are you asking about the Chosen for each god, or are you saying ""Champions"" are something different? The Chosen can be anyone as long as they exemplify that God's tenets and/or they work towards that God's goals. I honestly don't know what the exact percentage breakdown is, but the number of Chosen that are Clerics as a class has to be pretty low. I know a few of Mystra's Chosen had multiclassed Cleric per 3rd edition stat blocks, but overall I think the majority of Chosen aren't.

Cleric,"Question about gods, devils and their rights to souls Came here after BG3 and I would like to clarify a few things because I am confused. I don't know much about DnD lore, but as far as I know there is a Primeval Pact where devils can take the souls of people who made a deal with them and the gods agreed to it so they can have an army against the demons.  First of all, I would like to clarify some points from the game, is this just a liberty on the part of the developers?

Cleric,"Deities cannot override the Pact Primeval. Your soul belongs to the devil.   It's been addressed in a few books both crunch and fluff, but unless taken to trial, the devil always wins. It's because the Pact is based on primordial Law, which trumps every non-overdeity. In practice, it'd be a negotiation. Gale can offer something to Myzora, or if Myzora sold the contract to Zariel, and I can't imagine they wouldn't negotiate with him as a deity's favor is more valuable.

Cleric,"The way I play it (and this may vary from canon) is that there are some restrictions on when and how a devil can exercise their claim on a soul.  If the soul is dead and ends up on the fugue plane, it's clearly marked as the property of the bargaining fiend. The soul will then be sent into a collection area for the fiend or their representative to collect it at their leisure.

Cleric,It's not clear where Kanchy is actually worshipped. He's a multispheric deity and he's apparently so infamous that even Ravenloft's vampires fear and respect him. I'd assume that he's well-known enough among the older vampires of the Realms. The undead gods like Mellifleur and Kanchelsis seem to gain power and influence from the creation and actions of liches and vampires rather than actual formal worship (Kanchy IIRC has no formal priesthood but is still the same rank of deity as Lolth).
