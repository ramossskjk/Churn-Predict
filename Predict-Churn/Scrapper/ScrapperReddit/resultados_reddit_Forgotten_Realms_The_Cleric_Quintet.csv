The Cleric Quintet,"This series was written (or at least started) during 2nd edition.   This edition specifically did not have any concept of ‚Äúdevil‚Äù. While imps were still technically lawful evil, they were somewhat mischievous, winged things.  The rigid a devil is utterly lawful, and a demon is a ball of chaos thing didn‚Äôt exist at all in that edition (as a reaction to the tone of the 1980s and some very vocal people).

They weren‚Äôt part of the infernal hierarchy and probably didn‚Äôt even originate from there, although it‚Äôs pretty vague simply saying they‚Äôre from the lower planes. However, imps definitely were still lawful evil back then, so him being chaotic and working for a chaotic goddess to release a chaos curse was weird.

The Cleric Quintet,"Novels: Where to start (and did I miss anything big)? Many (many many) years ago, I read the first 10 Drizzt books. That was my introduction to the Realms.

The Cleric Quintet,"I really liked the Quintet, both in print as well as the audio book (Victor Bevine does an amazing job, especially with the dwarves).   Yes, this was written long before 5e, so some things work differently. I love how Druzil takes the place of the being Barjin was intending on summoning.   My favorite detail is how the Oghma priests love wrestling. They embody the mantra ""knowledge is power,"" and the fact that Danica has to 1v1 them for normal librarian duties is both hilarious and a fun way to ",MusclesDynamite,u/MusclesDynamite,2023-08-31T01:43:09,2,0,comentario,Neutro

It's definitely pulpy & won't win any great literature awards being foremost focused on thrills, action, & entertainment. But def is one of the series next to Harry Potter that I've read multiple times. FWIW, the audiobooks have a great narrator that gives an excellent performance.
